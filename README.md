## Local usage
First you need to set env variables:

```
export TELEGRAM_TOKEN=yourTelegramTokenRecievedFromBotFather
export DEBUG=true
```
Then run. Note, you need `Docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system
```
make run
```
To run tests: 
```
make clear
make test
```
To debug locally without docker use:
```
make clear
make setup
go run main.go
```
This should setup a database and run all the migrations for you. 

## Install on your server 
1. Build and push bot's image to Dockerhub or any other container registry: 
```
docker build  -t <youraccount>/mad-internship-bot  .
```
```
docker push <youraccount>/mad-internship-bot
```
2. Enter server, install `docker` and `docker-compose` there. Create `docker-compose.yaml` file by the example from this repo
3. Create `.env` file with variables needed to run bot:
```
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=603860531:AAEB95f4tq18RWZtKLFJDFLKFDFfdsfds
DEBUG=false
ONBORDING_MESSAGE="your onbording message here"
```
4. Pull image from registry and run it in the backgroud with

```
docker-compose up -d
```
